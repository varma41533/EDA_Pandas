#Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Population Statistics

Description: This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of world population statistics. The analysis explores key metrics such as population by year, continent-wise statistics, and correlation between different population-related attributes. The project involves cleaning the data by identifying null values, checking the number of unique values per column, and sorting based on the 2022 population. Key findings are visualized using correlation heatmaps and boxplots to detect outliers, and group-level statistics are derived through continent-wise aggregation. Finally, visualizations such as line plots and boxplots are used to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the global population data over time.
